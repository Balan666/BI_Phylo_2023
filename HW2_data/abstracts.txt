Aquaria species are characterized by their amazing colors and patterns. Research 
on the breeding molecular genetics of ornamental shrimps is surprisingly 
limited. We conducted a transcriptome analysis to investigate the expression of 
encoding genes in the integument of the strains Neocaridina denticulate 
sinensis. After assembled and filtered, 19,992 unigenes were annotated by 
aligning with public functional databases (NR, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG). 14,915 
unigenes with significantly different expressions were found by comparing three 
strains integument transcriptomes. Ribosomal protein genes, ABC transporter 
families, calmodulin, carotenoid proteins and crustacyanin may play roles in the 
cytological process of pigment migration and chromatophore maintenance. Numerous 
color genes associated with multiple pathways including melanin, ommochrome and 
pteridines pathways were identified. The expression patterns of 25 candidate 
genes were analysis by qPCR in red, yellow, transparent and glass strains. The 
qPCR results in red, yellow and transparent were consistent with the level of 
RPKM values in the transcriptomes. The above results will advance our knowledge 
of integument color varieties in N. denticulate sinensis and help the genetic 
selection of crustaceans with consumer-favored colors. Furthermore, it also 
provides some candidate pigmentation genes to investigate the correlation 
between coloration and sympatric speciation in crustaceans.

Pigment proteins play a vital role in the red colour change of the red swamp 
crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) shell after cooking. In this study, two 
red-change-related pigment proteins with molecular weights of approximately 170 
and 43 kDa-denoted as F1 and F2, respectively-were purified by ammonium sulphate 
salting-out and size exclusion chromatography. F1 and F2 entirely comprised 
homomultimeric protein complexes composed of 21 kDa subunits. LC-MS/MS analysis 
showed that the 21 kDa protein subunit belonged to the crustacyanin family, 
named P. clarkii crustacyanin A2 (PcCRA2). The full-length cDNA of PcCRA2 was 
cloned, which encoded 190 amino acid residues and was highly homologous (91.58%) 
with Cherax quadricarinatus crustacyanin A. The predicted 3D structure showed 
that PcCRA2 had a β-barrel structure for pigment encapsulation. The colour 
change of F1 was first detected at 40 °C, and the red change occurred upon 
heating above 60 °C. Additionally, with increasing temperature, its β-sheet 
content increased, and its α-helix content reduced. Correlation analysis showed 
that the redness value of F1 was significantly related to the heating 
temperature and the β-sheet content.

The valuable marine carotenoid, astaxanthin, is used in supplements, medicines 
and cosmetics. In this study, crustacyanin, an astaxanthin-binding protein, was 
used to solubilize and concentrate astaxanthin. The recombinant crustacyanin of 
European lobster spontaneously formed an inclusion body when it was 
over-expressed in Escherichia coli. In this study, fusing the NusA-tag to the 
crustacyanin subunits made it possible to express in a soluble fraction and 
solubilize astaxanthin in aqueous solution. By cutting off the NusA-tag, the 
crustacyanin subunits generated the pure insoluble form, and captured and 
concentrated astaxanthin. Overall, the attaching and releasing NusA-tag method 
has the potential to supply solubilized carotenoids in aqueous solution and 
concentrated carotenoids, respectively.

A mutant of the ridgetail white prawn, which exhibited rare orange-red body 
color with a higher level of free astaxanthin (ASTX) concentration than that in 
the wild-type prawn, was obtained in our lab. In order to understand the 
underlying mechanism for the existence of a high level of free astaxanthin, 
transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) between the mutant and wild-type prawns. A total of 78,224 unigenes 
were obtained, and 1863 were identified as DEGs, in which 902 unigenes showed 
higher expression levels, while 961 unigenes presented lower expression levels 
in the mutant in comparison with the wild-type prawns. Based on Gene Ontology 
analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, as well as 
further investigation of annotated DEGs, we found that the biological processes 
related to astaxanthin binding, transport, and metabolism presented significant 
differences between the mutant and the wild-type prawns. Some genes related to 
these processes, including crustacyanin, apolipoprotein D (ApoD), cathepsin, and 
cuticle proteins, were identified as DEGs between the two types of prawns. These 
data may provide important information for us to understand the molecular 
mechanism of the existence of a high level of free astaxanthin in the prawn.

Crustacyanin has the function of binding astaxanthin which is the best 
antioxidant, and plays an important role in the body color variation of 
crustaceans. To investigate the causes of body color variation of the ridgetail 
white prawn, Exopalaemon carinicauda, the present study obtained four subtypes 
of crustacyanin gene: C1, C2, A1, and A2. Based on fluorescence quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction, lipocalin-C1 is mainly expressed in the eyestalk, 
lipocalin-C2 is in the ventral nerve cord, and lipocalin-A1 and lipocalin-A2 are 
in subcutaneous adipose tissues. Under the inhibiting effect of Cd2+ stress, the 
expression of four subtypes first increases and then decreases within 24 h, and 
reaches the maximum at 6 or 12 h. RNA interference experiments showed a decrease 
in the expression of lipocalin genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue for each 
subtype, with the body color changing from transparent to red, and the dark red 
spots on the epidermis changing to bright red. Moreover, the blue protein in the 
subcutaneous adipose tissue largely disappeared, based on the light micrographs. 
In view of these findings, the crustacyanin gene appears to fulfill some 
function in the resistance to heavy metal stress and body color formation of E. 
carinicauda.

Hydrothermal vents are unique deep-sea environments exhibiting extreme 
temperature gradients and toxic concentrations of H2 S that limit the growth of 
biological communities. Notably, some decapod crustaceans are the dominant 
organisms inhabiting these environments, and share similar phenotypic and 
physiological traits, such as white body coloration and chemosynthetic capacity. 
However, a lack of genomic information has precluded an understanding of these 
convergent phenotypes. Here, comparative transcriptomic analyses were performed 
in 14 decapod species, including four deep-sea hydrothermal vent species and 10 
shallow-water relatives. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the four deep-sea 
species stemmed from different ancestors despite being geographically close, and 
therefore their similar traits were probably the product of convergent evolution 
rather than lineal inheritance. A total of 391 positively selected genes, 109 
parallel substituted genes and 33 significantly expanded gene families were 
identified in the deep-sea decapods. Among these, only the SNARE interactions in 
vesicular transport pathway was significantly enriched, with both positively 
selected genes and parallel substituted genes, suggesting that specific 
macromolecule transport might be a strong convergent evolution trait in deep-sea 
decapods. Furthermore, many genes involved in protein synthesis, processing and 
energy metabolism were detected under convergent evolution, suggesting a role 
for adaptive evolution in association with a specific metabolic pathway in 
response to chemosynthetic nutrition patterns. Moreover, our study suggests that 
convergently evolved white body colour might have resulted from the contraction 
of the crustacyanin gene family and the low content of astaxanthin in the body 
of deep-sea decapods. Therefore, this study provides valuable genetic evidence 
for convergent evolution in deep-sea decapods.

Color is an essential clue for intra- and interspecies communication, playing a 
role in selection and speciation. Coloration can be based on nanostructures and 
pigments; carotenoids and carotenoproteins are among the most widespread 
pigments in animals. Over 350 species and subspecies of amphipods (Crustacea: 
Amphipoda) endemic to Lake Baikal exhibit an impressive variability of colors 
and coloration patterns, including intraspecific color morphs. However, the 
mechanisms forming this diversity are underexplored, as while the carotenoid 
composition of several transparent, green, and red species was investigated, 
there have been no reports on the corresponding carotenoid-binding proteins. In 
this work, we analyze the coloration of two brightly colored Baikal amphipods 
characterized by intraspecific color variability, Eulimnogammarus cyaneus and E. 
vittatus. We showed that the color of either species is defined by the level of 
putative carotenoid-binding proteins similar to the pheromone/odorant-binding 
protein family, as the concentration of these putative crustacyanin analogs was 
higher in blue or teal-colored animals than in the orange- or yellow-colored 
ones. At the same time, the color did not depend on the total carotenoid 
content, as it was similar between animals of contrasting color morphs. By 
exploring the diversity of these sequences within a larger phylogeny of 
invertebrate crustacyanins, we show that amphipods lack orthologs of the 
well-studied crustacyanins A and C, even though they possess some 
crustacyanin-like sequences. The analysis of expression levels in E. cyaneus 
showed that the transcripts encoding crustacyanin analogs had much higher 
expression than the crustacyanin-like sequences, suggesting that the former 
indeed contribute to the color of these brightly colored animals. The 
crustacyanin analogs seem to act in a similar way to the well-studied 
crustacyanins in body color formation, but the details of their action are still 
to be revealed.

The keto-carotenoid deinoxanthin, which occurs in the UV-resistant bacterium 
Deinococcus radiodurans, has been investigated by ultrafast time-resolved 
spectroscopy techniques. We have explored the excited-state properties of 
deinoxanthin in solution and bound to the S-layer Deinoxanthin Binding Complex 
(SDBC), a protein complex important for UV resistance and thermostability of the 
organism. Binding of deinoxanthin to SDBC shifts the absorption spectrum to 
longer wavelengths, but excited-state dynamics remain unaffected. The lifetime 
of the lowest excited state (S1) of isolated deinoxanthin in methanol is 2.1 ps. 
When bound to SDBC, the S1 lifetime is 2.4 ps, indicating essentially no 
alteration of the effective conjugation length upon binding. Moreover, our data 
show that the conformational disorder in both ground and excited states is the 
same for deinoxanthin in methanol and bound to SDBC. Our results thus suggest a 
rather loosely bound carotenoid in SDBC, making it very distinct from other 
carotenoid-binding proteins such as Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) or 
crustacyanin, both of which significantly restrain the carotenoid at the binding 
site. Three deinoxanthin analogs were found to bind the SDBC, suggesting a 
non-selective binding site of deinoxanthin in SDBC.

Lipocalin is a large family with complex functions including retinol-binding 
protein (RBP), crustacyanin (CRCN), apolipoprotein D, etc. In shrimps, it is 
well known that CRCN is related to body color. Recently, retinoic 
acid/retinol-binding protein was found in shrimp. However, little is known about 
the function of RBP and relationships among the gene members of lipocalin in 
shrimps. Based on the transcriptome sequences responding to starvation stress, 
three genes of the lipocalin-retinol-binding protein-like gene family 
(lipocalin-1, lipocalin-2, and lipocalin-3) were cloned by RACE from the 
ridgetail white prawn, Exopalaemon carinicauda. Homology analysis showed that 
these three genes had high similarity with the known insect apolipoprotein D 
gene and vertebrate retinol-binding protein gene, and they are of the same type 
in terms of evolution. Fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that the above three 
genes were mainly expressed in the ventral nerve cord of E. carinicauda. The 
expression characteristics of the three genes at different developmental stages 
showed that they were more highly expressed at the larval stage, which suggests 
that they might be related to embryonic and larval development. The RNA 
interference tests showed that after silencing lipocalin-1 and lipocalin-3, the 
body color of individual shrimps turned slightly red and the blue pigment in the 
epidermis largely disappeared, but no significant change took place in the 
appearance of individuals after silencing lipocalin-2. In addition, on the 6th 
and 16th days of interference, dead shrimps appeared in the lipocalin-1 and 
lipocalin-3 interference groups. The dead shrimps had hard crusts and remained 
in a molting posture. Totally, this study showed that the retinol-binding 
protein-like gene obtained in this study had certain biological functions in the 
growth and development and body color formation as CRCN; in addition, it also 
plays a role in nerve system and molting of E. carinicauda.

Macromolecular crystallization is crucial to a large number of scientific 
fields, including structural biology; drug design, formulation, and delivery; 
manufacture of biomaterials; and preparation of foodstuffs. The purpose of this 
study is to facilitate control of crystallization, by investigating hydrophobic 
interface-assisted protein crystallization both theoretically and 
experimentally. The application of hydrophobic liquids as nucleation promoters 
or suppressors has rarely been investigated, and provides an underused avenue to 
explore in protein crystallization. Theoretically, crystal nucleation is 
regarded as a two-step process, the first step being a local increase in protein 
concentration due to its adsorption on the hydrophobic surface. Subsequently, 
the protein is ordered in a crystal lattice. The energetic aspect of crystal 
nucleation on water/hydrophobic substance interfaces is approached by 
calculating the balance between the cohesive energy maintaining integrity of the 
two-dimensional crystal nucleus and the sum of destructive energies tending to 
tear up the crystal. This is achieved by comparing the number of bonds shared by 
the units forming the crystal and the number of unshared (dangling) bonds on the 
crystal surface pointing toward the solution. The same approach is extended to 
three-dimensional protein crystal nucleation at water/hydrophobic liquid 
interfaces. Experimentally, we studied protein crystallization over oils and 
other hydrophobic liquids (paraffin oil, FC-70 Fluorinert fluorinated oil, and 
three chlorinated hydrocarbons). Crystallizations of α-lactalbumin and lysozyme 
are compared, and additional information is acquired by studying α-crustacyanin, 
trypsin, an insulin analogue, and protein Lpg2936. Depending on the protein 
type, concentration, and the interface aging time, the proteins exhibit 
different crystallization propensities depending on the hydrophobic liquid used. 
Some hydrophobic liquids provoke an increase in the effective supersaturation, 
which translates to enhancement of crystal nucleation at their interface with 
the crystallization solution, leading to the formation of crystals.

Understanding the microscopic origin of the color tuning in pigment-protein 
complexes is a challenging yet fundamental issue in photoactive biological 
systems. Here, we propose a possible interpretation by using a state-of-the-art 
multiscale strategy based on the integration of quantum chemistry and 
polarizable atomistic embeddings into a dynamic description. By means of such a 
strategy we are able to resolve the long-standing dispute over the coloration 
mechanism in the crustacyanin protein. It is shown that the combination of the 
dynamical flexibility of the carotenoid pigments (astaxanthin) with the 
responsive protein environment is essential to obtain quantitative predictions 
of the spectral tuning. The strong linear correlation between the excitation 
energies and the bond length alternation in the long-chain carotenoids modulated 
by the dynamical protein environment is a novel finding explaining the high 
color tunability in crustacyanin.

BACKGROUND: Black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon is one of the common causes of 
shellfish allergy that is increasing worldwide. One of the important problems in 
the management of shellfish allergy is the lack of accurate diagnostic assay 
because the biological and immunological properties of allergens in black tiger 
shrimp have not been well characterized. This study aims to detect proteins with 
the ability to bind and cross-link immunoglobulin E (IgE) from black tiger 
shrimp by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and a 
humanized rat basophilic leukemia reporter cell line RS-ATL8.
METHODS: Sera from shrimp allergic subjects were subjected to ELISA and Western 
blots using raw or cooked shrimp extract as antigens. Pooled sera were used to 
sensitize the RS-ATL8 reporter cell line and cells were activated by shrimp 
extract. Eluted protein extracts separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were tested on the RS-ATL8 cell 
line and subjected to mass spectrometry to identify potential candidate 
allergens.
RESULTS: Allergic sera reacted stronger to raw shrimp extract than cooked shrimp 
extract (P=0.009). Western blot demonstrated that major IgE reactivity protein 
bands were at 32-39 kDa and 91-230 kDa in both raw and cooked shrimp extracts. 
The eluted protein bands at the molecular weight of 38 and 115 kDa from raw 
shrimp extract induced IgE cross-linking as assayed by the RS-ATL8 cell line. 
These protein bands were subjected to mass spectrometry for analysis. 
Ubiquitin-activating enzyme and crustacyanin were identified as potential 
candidate novel shrimp allergens.
CONCLUSIONS: The RS-ATL8 reporter cell line can be used to identify potential 
new shrimp allergens that can functionally cross-link IgE and induce mast cell 
degranulation.

Crustaceans form their distinct patterns and colours through the interaction of 
the carotenoid astaxanthin with a protein called crustacyanin (CRCN). Presently, 
the expression of just two CRCN genes is thought to provide the protein subunits 
that combine to form the crustacyanin complex and associated carotenoid colour 
change from red to blue. This study aimed to explore the genetic complexity 
underlying the production of pigmentation and camouflage in penaeid shrimp. We 
isolated 35 new CRCN genes from 12 species, and their sequence analysis 
indicated that this gene family has undergone significant expansion and 
diversification in this lineage. Despite this duplication and sequence 
divergence, the structure of the CRCN proteins and their functional role in 
shrimp colour production has been strictly conserved. Using CRCN isoforms from 
Penaeus monodon as an example, we showed that isoforms were differentially 
expressed, and that subtle phenotypes were produced by the specific 
downregulation of individual isoforms. These findings demonstrate that our 
knowledge of the molecular basis of pigmentation in shrimp was overly 
simplistic, and suggests that multiple copies of the CRCN genes within species 
may be advantageous for colour production. This result is of interest for the 
origin and evolution of pigmentation in crustaceans, and the mechanisms by which 
gene function is maintained, diversified or sub-functionalized.

The chemical basis of the blue-black to pink-orange color change on cooking of 
lobster, due to thermal denaturation of an astaxanthin-protein complex, 
α-crustacyanin, in the lobster carapace, has so far been elusive. Here, we 
investigate the relaxation of the astaxanthin pigment from its bound enolate 
form to its neutral hydroxyketone form, as origin of the spectral shift, by 
analyzing the response of UV-vis spectra of a water-soluble 
3-hydroxy-4-oxo-β-ionone model of astaxanthin to increases in pH, and by 
performing extensive quantum chemical calculations over a wide range of chemical 
conditions. The enolization of astaxanthin is consistent with the X-ray 
diffraction data of β-crustacyanin (PDB code: ) whose crystals possess the 
distinct blue color. We find that enolate formation is possible within the 
protein environment and associated with a large bathochromic shift, thus 
offering a cogent explanation for the blue-black color and the response to 
thermal denaturation and revealing the chemistry of astaxanthin upon complex 
formation.

Time-resolved Laue protein crystallography at the European Synchrotron Radiation 
Facility (ESRF) opened up the field of sub-nanosecond protein crystal structure 
analyses. There are a limited number of such time-resolved studies in the 
literature. Why is this? The X-ray laser now gives us femtosecond (fs) duration 
pulses, typically 10 fs up to ∼50 fs. Their use is attractive for the fastest 
time-resolved protein crystallography studies. It has been proposed that single 
molecules could even be studied with the advantage of being able to measure 
X-ray diffraction from a 'crystal lattice free' single molecule, with or without 
temporal resolved structural changes. This is altogether very challenging R&D. 
So as to assist this effort we have undertaken studies of metal clusters that 
bind to proteins, both 'fresh' and after repeated X-ray irradiation to assess 
their X-ray-photo-dynamics, namely Ta6Br12, K2PtI6 and K2PtBr6 bound to a test 
protein, hen egg white lysozyme. These metal complexes have the major advantage 
of being very recognisable shapes (pseudo spherical or octahedral) and thereby 
offer a start to (probably very difficult) single molecule electron density map 
interpretations, both static and dynamic. A further approach is to investigate 
the X-ray laser beam diffraction strength of a well scattering nano-cluster; an 
example from nature being the iron containing ferritin. Electron crystallography 
and single particle electron microscopy imaging offers alternatives to X-ray 
structural studies; our structural studies of crustacyanin, a 320 kDa protein 
carotenoid complex, can be extended either by electron based techniques or with 
the X-ray laser representing a fascinating range of options. General outlook 
remarks concerning X-ray, electron and neutron macromolecular crystallography as 
well as 'NMR crystallography' conclude the article.

White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a pathogen that causes considerable 
mortality of the farmed shrimp, Penaeus monodon. Candidate 'vaccines', WSSV 
envelope protein VP28 and formalin-inactivated WSSV, can provide short-lived 
protection against the virus. In this study, P. monodon was orally intubated 
with the aforementioned vaccine candidates, and protein expression in the gut of 
immunised shrimps was profiled. The alterations in protein profiles in shrimps 
infected orally with live-WSSV were also examined. Seventeen of the identified 
proteins in the vaccine and WSSV-intubated shrimps varied significantly compared 
to those in the control shrimps. These proteins, classified under exoskeletal, 
cytoskeletal, immune-related, intracellular organelle part, intracellular 
calcium-binding or energy metabolism, are thought to directly or indirectly 
affect shrimp's immunity. The changes in the expression levels of crustacyanin, 
serine proteases, myosin light chain, and ER protein 57 observed in orally 
vaccinated shrimp may probably be linked to immunoprotective responses. On the 
other hand, altered expression of proteins linked to exoskeleton, calcium 
regulation and energy metabolism in WSSV-intubated shrimps is likely to 
symbolise disturbances in calcium homeostasis and energy metabolism.

Hydrocarbon pollution is a major environmental threat to ecosystems in marine 
and freshwater environments, but its toxicological effect on aquatic organisms 
remains little studied. A proteomic approach was used to analyze the effect of a 
freshwater oil spill on the prawn Macrobrachium borellii. To this aim, proteins 
were extracted from midgut gland (hepatopancreas) of male and female prawns 
exposed 7 days to a sublethal concentration (0.6 ppm) of water-soluble fraction 
of crude oil (WSF). Exposure to WSF induced responses at the protein expression 
level. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) revealed 10 protein spots that 
were differentially expressed by WSF exposure. Seven proteins were identified 
using MS/MS and de novo sequencing. Nm23 oncoprotein, arginine 
methyltransferase, fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase 
were down-regulated, whereas two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
isoforms and a lipocalin-like crustacyanin (CTC) were up-regulated after WSF 
exposure. CTC mRNA levels were further analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR 
showing an increased expression after WSF exposure. The proteins identified are 
involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, detoxification, transport of 
hydrophobic molecules and cellular homeostasis among others. These results 
provide evidence for better understanding the toxic mechanisms of hydrocarbons. 
Moreover, some of these differentially expressed proteins would be employed as 
potential novel biomarkers.

We report on ultrafast spectroscopy study of β-crustacyanin, the carotenoprotein 
responsible for the coloration of the lobster shell. β-Crustacyanin is formed by 
two closely positioned astaxanthin molecules encapsulated in protein. The 2D 
electronic spectroscopy together with two-color pump-probe was applied to 
investigate the electronic structure, the excited-state dynamics, and the 
influence of the excitonic interaction between the two carotenoids in 
β-crustacyanin. By using the ∼20 fs laser pulses tuned to absorption bands of 
the S0-S2 and S1-Sn transitions of carotenoids, we were able to trace full 
excitation relaxation dynamics, starting with S2-S1 relaxation on the ∼30 fs 
time scale and finishing with the ground-state recovery of 3.2 ps. Superimposed 
on the relaxation dynamics in the 2D spectra, we observed long-lived beating 
signals at the characteristic frequencies of astaxanthin vibrational modes. We 
assign these oscillations to the ground-state vibrational wavepacket dynamics. 
All major features of the 2D spectra, including amplitude and phase maps of the 
long-lived oscillations, were reproduced by employing the exciton-vibronic 
model. Consistent modeling of all optical properties of β-crustacyanin 
(including absorption and circular dichroism spectra) points to the relatively 
weak coupling between the two astaxanthin molecules (∼250 cm(-1)). This implies 
that the excitonic coupling provides insignificant contribution to the 
bathochromic shift in β-crustacyanin. We discuss the origin of the shift and 
propose that it is caused by two major effects: conformational changes of 
astaxanthin molecules (increase in effective conjugation length) together with 
increased charge-transfer character of the S2 state. We put the bathochromic 
shift in the broad perspective of other "blue" carotenoids properties.

merguiensis.

INTRODUCTION: Body colouration in animals can have a range of functions, with 
predator protection an important aspect of colour in crustaceans. Colour 
determination is associated with the carotenoid astaxanthin, which is taken up 
through the diet and stabilised in the tissues by the protein crustacyanin. As a 
variety of genes are found to play a role in colour formation in other systems, 
a holistic approach was employed in this study to determine the factors involved 
in Fenneropenaeus merguiensis colouration.
RESULTS: Full length F. merguiensis crustacyanin subunit A and C sequences were 
isolated. Crustacyanin subunit A and C were found in the F. merguiensis 
transcriptomes of the muscle/cuticle tissue, hepatopancreas, eye stalk and 
nervous system, using 454 next generation sequencing technology. Custom 
microarray analysis of albino, light and dark F. merguiensis cuticle tissue 
showed genes encoding actin, sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein and arginine 
kinase to be 4-fold or greater differentially expressed (p<0.05) and 
down-regulated in albinos when compared to light and dark samples. QPCR 
expression analysis of crustacyanin and total astaxanthin pigment extraction 
revealed significantly (p<0.05) lower crustacyanin subunit A and C gene 
transcript copy numbers and total astaxanthin levels in albinos than in the 
light and dark samples. Additionally, crustacyanin subunit A and C expression 
levels correlated positively with each other.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified gene products putatively involved in 
crustacean colouration, such as crustacyanin, sarcoplasmic calcium-binding 
protein and forms of actin, and investigated differences in gene expression and 
astaxanthin levels between albino, light and dark coloured prawns. These genes 
open a path to enhance our understanding of the biology and regulation of colour 
formation.

Crustacean crustacyanin proteins are linked to the production and modification 
of carapace colour, with direct implications for fitness and survival. Here, the 
structural and functional properties of the two recombinant crustacyanin 
subunits H(1) and H(2) from the American lobster Homarus americanus are 
reported. The two subunits are structurally highly similar to the corresponding 
natural apo crustacyanin CRTC and CRTA subunits from the European lobster H. 
gammarus. Reconstitution studies of the recombinant crustacyanin proteins H(1) 
and H(2) with astaxanthin reproduced the bathochromic shift of 85-95 nm typical 
of the natural crustacyanin subunits from H. gammarus in complex with 
astaxanthin. Moreover, correlations between the presence of crustacyanin genes 
in crustacean species and the resulting carapace colours with the spectral 
properties of the subunits in complex with astaxanthin confirmed this 
genotype-phenotype linkage.

Understanding of the widespread biological importance of carotenoids is 
increasing. Accompanying this is the developing recognition that the interaction 
of carotenoids with other molecules, such as proteins, is also essential. Here 
the significance of carotenoid-protein interactions with respect to biological 
function is reviewed for three well characterised carotenoprotein complexes; 
crustacyanin, the orange carotenoid protein and glutathione-S-transferase P1. In 
addition a preliminary report is made on the recent partial purification of an 
echinenone-binding protein extracted from a New Zealand sea urchin, Evechinus

Exposure of prawns to dark- or light-coloured substrates is known to trigger a 
strong colour adaptation response through expansion or contraction of the 
colouration structures in the prawn hypodermis. Despite the difference in colour 
triggered by this adaptive response, total levels of the predominant carotenoid 
pigment, astaxanthin, are not modified, suggesting that another mechanism is 
regulating this phenomenon. Astaxanthin binds to a specific protein called 
crustacyanin (CRCN), and it is the interaction between the quantities of each of 
these compounds that produces the diverse range of colours seen in crustacean 
shells. In this study, we investigated the protein changes and genetic 
regulatory processes that occur in prawn hypodermal tissues during adaptation to 
black or white substrates. The amount of free astaxanthin was higher in animals 
adapted to dark substrate compared with those adapted to light substrate, and 
this difference was matched by a strong elevation of CRCN protein. However, 
there was no difference in the expression of CRCN genes either across the moult 
cycle or in response to background substrate colour. These results indicate that 
exposure to a dark-coloured substrate causes an accumulation of CRCN protein, 
bound with free astaxanthin, in the prawn hypodermis without modification of 
CRCN gene expression. On light-coloured substrates, levels of CRCN protein in 
the hypodermis are reduced, but the carotenoid is retained, undispersed in the 
hypodermal tissue, in an esterified form. Therefore, the abundance of CRCN 
protein affects the distribution of pigment in prawn hypodermal tissues, and is 
a crucial regulator of the colour adaptation response in prawns.

The bathochromic shift (>0.5 eV) in the absorption spectrum of the carotenoid 
astaxanthin upon incorporation into crustacyanin proteins is investigated. 
Several previously suggested explanations are tested and assessed by direct 
comparison to experimental absorption and circular dichroism spectra. We 
investigate the effect of extended models for the protein binding pocket, which 
results in only small contributions to the total shift. The possible explanation 
in terms of protonated histidine residues interacting with the astaxanthin 
molecules is analyzed by calculation of nuclear magnetic resonance chemical 
shifts. The results indicate that such a protonation is unlikely. In addition, 
we show that excitonic couplings are too weak to explain the red shift in the 
absorption spectrum, but the resulting intensity distribution actually leads to 
a blue shift of the major absorption peak. These findings are corroborated by a 
comparison of the theoretical and experimental circular dichroism spectra. We 
analyze changes in the relative orientation of the two astaxanthin molecules 
present in β-crustacyanin, which may lead to increased excitonic coupling and 
modified intensity distributions.

The low-resolution structure of α-crustacyanin has been determined to 30 Å 
resolution using negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) with single-particle 
averaging. The protein, which is an assembly of eight β-crustacyanin dimers, 
appears asymmetrical and rather open in layout. A model was built to the EM map 
using the X-ray crystallographic structure of β-crustacyanin guided by PISA 
interface analyses. The model has a theoretical sedimentation coefficient that 
matches well with the experimentally derived value from sedimentation velocity 
analytical ultracentrifugation. Additionally, the EM model has similarities to 
models calculated independently by rigid-body modelling to small-angle X-ray 
scattering (SAXS) data and extracted in silico from the β-crustacyanin crystal 
lattice. Theoretical X-ray scattering from each of these models is in reasonable 
agreement with the experimental SAXS data and together suggest an overall design 
for the α-crustacyanin assembly.

Hypoxia, as one suboptimal environmental condition, can affect the physiological 
state of shrimp during pond aquaculture. To better understand the mechanism of 
response to hypoxic stress in Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis, proteome 
research approach was utilized. Differentially expressed proteins of 
hepatopancreas in adult Chinese shrimp between the control and hypoxia-stressed 
groups were screened. By 2-DE analysis, 67 spots showed obvious changes after 
hypoxia. Using LC-ESI-MS/MS, 51 spots representing 33 proteins were identified 
including preamylase, arginine kinase, phosphopyruvate hydratase, citrate 
synthase, ATP synthase alpha subunit, chymotrypsin BI, chitinase, ferritin, 
C-type lectin receptors, transketolase, formylglutathione hydrolase, 
formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, glutathione 
peroxidase, cytosolic manganese superoxide dismutase, protein disulfide 
isomerase, beta-actin, oncoprotein nm23, crustacyanin-C1 and so on. These 
proteins could be functionally classified into several groups such as proteins 
related to energy production, metabolism-related proteins, immune-related 
proteins, antioxidant proteins, chaperones, cytoskeleton proteins and ungrouped 
proteins. The transcription levels of ten selected genes encode the identified 
proteins were analyzed by real-time PCR at different sampling times of hypoxia. 
This study is the first analysis of differentially expressed proteins in the 
hepatopancreas of shrimp after hypoxia and provides a new insight for further 
study in hypoxic stress response of shrimp at the protein level.

Carotenoprotein, containing astaxanthin as the prosthetic group was extracted 
from the carapace shells of the lobster, Jasus lalandii. The material, with a 
molecular mass of around 400,000 Da and lambda(max) 525 nm (alpha-crustacyanin), 
was readily converted under the conditions used for extraction and on standing 
to the subunit (beta-crustacyanin) of molecular mass around 40,000 Da and 
lambda(max) 560 nm. The latter complex was stable up to 65 degrees C and between 
pH 5 and 8. Both the large molecule and the subunit showed the reversible 
bathochromic shift (lambda(max) approximately 480 nm) after being subjected to 
conditions of heat above 65 degrees C and below 85 degrees C and pH between 3 
and 10, which alter the natural protein orientation. Above 85 degrees C and 
outside of the pH range, the shift was irreversible. Crustacyanin from J. 
lalandii differed from the blue crustacyanin of the Homarus species with respect 
to visible spectra (lambda(max) 632 nm and lambda(max) 585 nm) and by displaying 
a hypsochromic shift between the alpha- and beta-crustacyanin. Stability of the 
alpha-crustacyanin and affinity to DE52 also differed. Yellow protein, with a 
lambda(max) 409/410 nm as described for the Homarus species was not detected in 
this J. lalandii study, although it may have been co-eluted. The properties of 
the extracted complex show potential for its use as a natural water soluble food 
colourant or temperature sensitive indicator.

color.

Carotenoids are commonly used by disparate metazoans to produce external 
coloration, often in direct association with specific proteins. In one such 
example, crustacyanin (CRCN) and the carotenoid astaxanthin combine to form a 
multimeric protein complex that is critical for the array of external shell 
colors in clawed lobsters. Through a combined biochemical, molecular genetic, 
and bioinformatic survey of the distribution of CRCN across the animal kingdom, 
we have found that CRCNs are restricted to, but widespread among, malacostracan 
crustaceans. These crustacean-specific genes separate into two distinct clades 
within the lipocalin protein superfamily. We show that CRCN differentially 
localizes to colored shell territories and the underlying epithelium in 
panulirid lobsters. Given the paramount importance of CRCN in crustacean shell 
colors and patterns and the critical role these play in survival, reproduction, 
and communication, we submit that the origin of the CRCN gene family early in 
the evolution of malacostracan crustaceans significantly contributed to the 
success of this group of arthropods.

Excited-state modeling of the astaxanthin dimer predicts a minor contribution 
from exciton coupling to the bathochromic shift in crustacyanin.

The >0.50 eV bathochromic shift of the absorption by the carotenoid astaxanthin 
in crustacyanin, the carotenoprotein responsible for the coloration of lobster 
shell, is believed to result from ground-state polarization of the chromophore 
and/or exciton coupling between the two chromophores of each protein subunit. 
Here, the contribution of exciton coupling to the shift is quantified using 
quantum chemical calculations that do not rely on the dipole-dipole 
approximation but rather consider the full astaxanthin dimer in the geometry 
relevant for the protein-bound state. Employing a variety of methods, it is 
found that the exciton coupling amounts to 0.04 eV only. Furthermore, even when 
more closely aggregated dimers than the one in the protein are considered, the 
predicted couplings remain small (0.05-0.09 eV). These findings demonstrate that 
the bathochromic shift cannot be explained in terms of exciton coupling. It is 
therefore argued that polarization is likely to be the dominant mechanism, a 
notion supported by the fact that calculations carried out at the same levels of 
theory identify a scenario (hydrogen bonding with a histidine residue) whose 
contribution to the shift vastly exceeds that of exciton coupling.

The crystal structures of the 6-s-cis [s-cis-(1)] and 6-s-trans [s-trans-(1)] 
conformers of the diacetates of astaxanthin (AXT) and those of 
(3S,3'S)-7,8-didehydroastaxanthin 
[(3S,3'S)-3,3'-dihydroxy-7,8-didehydro-beta,beta-carotene-4,4'-dione (2)] and 
(3S,3'S)-7,8,7',8'-tetradehydroastaxanthin 
[(3S,3'S)-3,3'-dihydroxy-7,8,7',8'-tetradehydro-beta,beta-carotene-4, 4'-dione 
(3)] are reported. The conformations of these four molecules vary in particular 
with the angle of twist of the end rings out of the plane of the polyene chain; 
for s-cis-(1), the end rings are twisted out of the plane of the polyene chain 
by an angle of -49.0 (5)degrees , and the conformation is therefore similar to 
that found for unesterified AXT as well as for the carotenoids, canthaxanthin 
and beta,beta-carotene. For s-trans-(1), the end rings are coplanar with the 
polyene chain and its conformation is much more similar to that of the 
protein-bound AXT in the blue protein, crustacyanin, which is found in the shell 
of lobsters, although s-trans-(1) shows much less bowing of the polyene chain. 
In (2) and (3) the end rings are also almost coplanar with the polyene chain 
with the end rings in (2) in the s-cis conformation, and in (3) in the s-trans 
conformation. Thus, an extensive ensemble of the possible beta end-ring 
conformations has been determined. These structures are compared with one 
another as well as unbound, unesterified AXT and protein-bound AXT. Also, the 
effect of the end-ring conformations on the colour and UV-vis spectra of the 
crystals was established.

Column (CC), thin-layer (TLC), high-performance liquid (HPLC) and ion-exchange 
chromatography (IEC), were used to investigate corotenoid and carotenoprotein 
complexes in Asellus aquaticus specimens from the Narew river. The following 
carotenoids were found: alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, 
lutein, zeaxanthin, diadinoxanthin, mutatoxanthin, crustaxanthin, echinenone, 
hydroxyechinenone, phoenicoxanthin, canthaxanthin and astaxanthin. Astaxanthin 
(37.5%), canthaxanthin (21.4%) and phoenicoxanthin (12.3%) were found in the 
largest amounts. The total carotenoid content was 13.824 microg g(-1) of dry 
mass. Carotenoprotein complexes containing astaxanthin as the prosthetic group 
were purified from Asellus aquaticus. The carotenoprotein complexes belonged to 
the crustacyanins group as alpha- and gamma-crustacyanin. The protein forming 
the alpha-crustacyanin contained large amounts of such amino-acids as asparic 
acid, glutamic acid and leucine, whereas the protein of the gamma-crustacyanin 
contained primarily glutamic acid, glycine and lysine.

This effort is focused on the use of crustacyanin protein extracted from the 
lobster shell in IR detection and imaging applications. In addition to the 
protein's excellent reversible thermo-active response in the IR region of 
interest, electrical characteristics versus temperature showed that the protein 
can be used as an electro-optic thermal sensing device as well. The high 
sensitivity and fast response of the protein layer were further enhanced by the 
deposition process we used. The thin coatings were prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett 
and self-assembly techniques. Furthermore, the protein exhibited temperature 
variation under Ti:sapphire laser excitation at different wavelengths in ambient 
environment. We have also shown that the protein exhibits fluorescence 
properties after exposure to IR heat. Stability of the protein, which is 
important in this type of application, was also demonstrated using the different 
characterization techniques after repeated heating/cooling cycles. We can 
conclude that this protein represents a formidable candidate for the fabrication 
of IR sensors and microbolometers for uncooled IR imaging applications.

The crystal structures of the unbound carotenoids, synthetic astaxanthin 
(3S,3'S:3R,3'S:3R,3'R in a 1:2:1 ratio), canthaxanthin and (3R,3'S, 
meso)-zeaxanthin are compared with each other and the protein bound astaxanthin 
molecule in the carotenoprotein, beta-crustacyanin. Three new crystal forms of 
astaxanthin have been obtained, using different crystallization conditions, 
comprising a chloroform solvate, a pyridine solvate and an unsolvated form. In 
each structure, the astaxanthin molecules, which are similar to one another, are 
centrosymmetric and adopt the 6-s-cis conformation; the end rings are bent out 
of the plane of the polyene chain by angles of -42.6 (5), -48.9 (5) and -50.4 
(3) degrees , respectively, and are disordered, showing the presence of both R 
and S configurations (in a 1:1 ratio). In the crystal packing of the chloroform 
and pyridine solvates, the astaxanthin molecules show pair-wise end-to-end 
intermolecular hydrogen bonding of the adjacent 3-hydroxyl and 4-keto oxygens, 
whereas in the unsolvated crystal form, the hydrogen-bonding interaction is 
intermolecular. In addition, there are intermolecular C-H hydrogen bonds in all 
three structures. The canthaxanthin structure, measured at 100 and 293 K, also 
adopts the 6-s-cis conformation, but with disorder of one end ring only. The 
rotation of the end rings out of the plane of the polyene chains (ca -50 degrees 
for each structure) is similar to that of astaxanthin. A number of possible C-H 
hydrogen bonds to the keto O atoms are also observed. (3R,3'S, meso)-zeaxanthin 
is centrosymmetric with a C5-C6-C7-C8 torsion angle of -74.9 (3) degrees ; the 
molecules show pair-wise hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl O atoms. In 
addition, for all the crystal structures the polyene chains were arranged one 
above the other, with intermolecular distances of 3.61-3.79 A, indicating the 
presence of pi-stacking interactions. Overall, these six crystal structures 
provide an ensemble of experimentally derived results that allow several key 
parameters, thought to influence colour tuning of the bathochromic shift of 
astaxanthin in crustacyanin, to be varied. The fact that the colour of each of 
the six crystals remains red, rather than turning blue, is therefore especially 
significant.

In invertebrates and vertebrates, carotenoids are ubiquitous colorants, 
antioxidants, and provitamin A compounds that must be absorbed from dietary 
sources and transported to target tissues where they are taken up and stabilized 
to perform their physiological functions. These processes occur in a specific 
and regulated manner mediated by high-affinity carotenoid-binding proteins. In 
this mini-review, we examine the published literature on carotenoid-binding 
proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate systems, and we report our initial 
purification and characterization of a novel lutein-binding protein isolated 
from liver of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica).

The benefits of protein crystal growth in microgravity are well documented. The 
crystallization vessels currently employed for microgravity crystallization are 
far from optimal with regards to cost, sample volume, size, and ease of use. The 
use of microbatch experiments is a favorable alternative in each respect: 96 
experiments of 0.5-2 microL volumes can be performed in a single microtiter tray 
measuring 5 x 8 cm and costing 1 pound sterling each. To date, the use of 
microbatch has not been pursued on account of concerns of oil leakage. To 
address this issue, a novel approach to microbatch crystallization experiments 
is described, where the microbatch plates are inverted throughout the duration 
of the experiment. The findings intimate the application of the microbatch 
method to space flight and the potential to drastically increase the output of 
microgravity crystallization research .

The centrifugal increase of concentration is nondestructive, rapid, and simple 
technology. Therefore it is used to create a higher supersaturation that is 
required for crystal nucleation, as the one that is appropriate for the 
subsequent growth. Crystal nucleation is evoked in glass capillary tubes filled 
with protein solutions. The couple ferritin/ apoferritin is used as model 
proteins in the present article. Although differing in their masses the two 
(quasi) spherical molecules have exactly the same size and surface properties. 
Together with the temperature-independent solubility this makes them very 
convenient for our investigations. Decoupling nucleation and growth, for 
example, by means of hypergravity makes it possible to grow 
quasi-equidimensional crystals. The use of monodisperse crystalline forms of 
therapeutic agents can ensure constant time-release of protein-based 
medications.

Protein-bound chromophores astaxanthin and phytochromobilin: excited state 
quantum chemical studies.

We present an overview of excited state quantum chemical calculations aimed at 
elucidating controversial issues regarding the photochemistry of the 
protein-bound chromophores astaxanthin and phytochromobilin. In particular, we 
show how the application of time-dependent density functional theory and other 
single-reference quantum chemical excited state methods have contributed to shed 
new light on the origin of the >0.5 eV bathochromic shift of the electronic 
absorption by the carotenoid astaxanthin in the protein macromolecular complex 
crustacyanin, and the mechanism for C15-Z,syn --> C15-E,anti isomerization of 
the tetrapyrrole phytochromobilin that underlies the photoactivation of the 
plant photoreceptor phytochrome. Within the approximation that exciton coupling 
is neglected, the calculations on astaxanthin provide support for the notion 
that the bathochromic shift, which is responsible for the slate-blue coloration 
of lobster shell, is due to polarization rather than a conformational change of 
the chromophore in the protein-bound state. Furthermore, the polarization is 
attributed to a hydrogen-bonded protonated histidine residue. The calculations 
on phytochromobilin, in turn, suggest that a stepwise C15-Z,syn --> C15-E,syn 
(photochemical), C15-E,syn --> C15-E,anti (thermal) mechanism is much more 
favorable than a concerted, fully photochemical mechanism, and that neutral 
forms of the chromophore are much less likely to photoisomerize than the parent, 
protonated form. Accordingly, the calculations indirectly support the view that 
the photoactivation of phytochrome does not involve a proton transfer from the 
chromophore to the surrounding protein.

Steady-state absorption and femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopic studies have 
been carried out on astaxanthin dissolved in CS2, methanol, and acetonitrile, 
and in purified alpha-crustacyanin. The spectra of the S0 --> S2 and S1 --> S(n) 
transitions were found to be similarly dependent on solvent environment. The 
dynamics of the excited-state decay processes were analyzed with both single 
wavelength and global fitting procedures. In solution, the S1 lifetime of 
astaxanthin was found to be approximately 5 ps and independent of solvent. In 
alpha-crustacyanin, the lifetime was noticeably shorter at approximately 1.8 ps. 
Both fitting procedures led to the conclusion that the lifetime of the S2 state 
was either comparable to or shorter than the instrument response time. The data 
support the idea that dimerization of astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin is the 
primary molecular basis for the bathochromic shift of the S0 --> S2 and S1 --> 
S(n) transitions. Planarization of the astaxanthin molecule, which leads to a 
longer effective pi-electron conjugated chain and a lower S1 energy, accounts 
for the shorter tau1 in the protein.

The determination of high-resolution structures of proteins requires crystals of 
suitable quality. Because of the new impetus given to structural biology by 
structural genomics/proteomics, the problem of crystallizing proteins is 
becoming increasingly acute. There is therefore an urgent requirement for the 
development of new efficient methods to aid crystal growth. Nucleation is the 
crucial step that determines the entire crystallization process. Hence, the holy 
grail is to design a "universal nucleant," a substrate that induces the 
nucleation of crystals of any protein. We report a theory for nucleation on 
disordered porous media and its experimental testing and validation using a 
mesoporous bioactive gel-glass. This material induced the crystallization of the 
largest number of proteins ever crystallized using a single nucleant. The 
combination of the model and the experimental results opens up the scope for the 
rational design of nucleants, leading to alternative means of controlling 
crystallization.

To resolve the molecular basis of the coloration mechanism of 
alpha-crustacyanin, we used (13)C-labeled astaxanthins as chromophores for 
solid-state (13)C NMR and resonance Raman spectroscopy of [6,6',7,7']-(13)C(4) 
alpha-crustacyanin and [8,8',9,9',10,10',11,11',20,20']-(13)C(10) 
alpha-crustacyanin. We complement the experimental data with time-dependent 
density functional theory calculations on several models based on the structural 
information available for beta-crustacyanin. The data rule out major changes and 
strong polarization effects in the ground-state electron density of astaxanthin 
upon binding to the protein. Conformational changes in the chromophore and 
hydrogen-bond interactions between the astaxanthin and the protein can account 
only for about one-third of the total bathochromic shift in alpha-crustacyanin. 
The exciton coupling due to the proximity of two astaxanthin chromophores is 
found to be large, suggesting that aggregation effects in the protein represent 
the primary source of the color change.

Effects of buoyancy-driven convection on nucleation and growth of protein 
crystals.

Protein crystallization has been studied in presence or absence of 
buoyancy-driven convection. Gravity-driven flow was created, or suppressed, in 
protein solutions by means of vertically directed density gradients that were 
caused by generating suitable temperature gradients. The presence of enhanced 
mixing was demonstrated directly by experiments with crustacyanin, a 
blue-colored protein, and other materials. Combined with the vertical tube 
position the enhanced convection has two main effects. First, it reduces the 
number of nucleated hen-egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) crystals, as compared with 
those in a horizontal capillary. By enabling better nutrition from the protein 
in the solution, convection results in growth of fewer larger HEWL crystals. 
Second, we observe that due to convection, trypsin crystals grow faster. 
Suppression of convection, achieved by decreasing solution density upward in the 
capillary, can to some extent mimic conditions of growth in microgravity. Thus, 
impurity supply, which may have a detrimental effect on crystal quality, was 
avoided.

The blue carotenoprotein alpha-crustacyanin of Homarus gammarus lobster carapace 
is comprised chemically of five 20 kDa subunits. Only two genes for the proteins 
have been isolated (J. B. C. Findlay, personal communication) and the five 
apoproteins fall into two sets of homologous proteins based on their chemical 
properties (CRTC, consisting of apoproteins C(1), C(2) and A(1), and CRTA, 
consisting of apoproteins A(2) and A(3)). The diffraction quality of apo C(2) 
has been improved from 2.2 to 1.3 A and its structure solved. The structure is 
compared with the A(1) and C(1) proteins determined at 1.4 A [Cianci et al. 
(2001), Acta Cryst. D57, 1219-1229] and 1.15 A, respectively [Gordon et al. 
(2001), Acta Cryst. D57, 1230-1237] and found to be very similar. Normalized 
B-factor difference plots per residue of different types were used to try to 
find chemically modified residues; none were found at these resolutions. It 
remains possible that the differences between the CRTC proteins result from 
differences in amidation. By comparison of a crystal grown with glycerol 
(studied at 1.6 A) and one grown without glycerol (studied at 1.3 A) it was seen 
that glycerol bound at the astaxanthin site.

It has been suggested that astaxanthin 
(3,3'-dihydroxy-beta,beta-carotene-4,4'-dione) in the carotenoprotein 
alpha-crustacyanin occurs in the diprotonated form. As a model system for 
protonated astaxanthin in [small alpha]-crustacyanin the reactions of 
canthaxanthin ([small beta],[small beta]-carotene-4,4[prime or minute]-dione) 
with Bronsted acids (CF(3)COOH and CF(3)SO(3)H) and the Lewis acid 
BF(3)-etherate have been investigated. Structures of C-5 protonated, C-7 
protonated, enolised O-4 protonated and O-4,4[prime or minute], C-7 
triprotonated canthaxanthin have been established by VIS-NIR and NMR 
spectroscopy. The charge distribution in the cations has been considered by 
comparison of the (13)C chemical shift difference relative to neutral relevant 
carotenoid models. The experimental evidence for protonated canthaxanthins 
differs significantly from previous AM1 calculations. Experimental data for 
O-4,4[prime or minute], C-7 triprotonated canthaxanthin relative to C-7 
protonated canthaxanthin is considered a relevant model for O-4,4[prime or 
minute] diprotonated canthaxanthin, in comparison with neutral canthaxanthin. 
The positive charge was mainly located at C-6/6[prime or minute][dbl 
greater-than] C-8/8[prime or minute] > C-10/10[prime or minute] > C-12/12[prime 
or minute] > C-14/14[prime or minute][similar] C-15/15[prime or minute] in the 
polyene chain. Moreover, it was inferred that only 14% of the positive charge is 
delocalised to the polyene chain, the remaining charge must therefore be located 
at the protonated carbonyl moiety. The results are discussed in relation to 
previous solid state NMR studies of (13)C labelled astaxanthin in [small 
alpha]-crustacyanin and recent X-ray analysis of [small beta]-crustacyanin.

Biochemistry, biological crystallography, spectroscopy, solution X-ray 
scattering and microscopy have been applied to study the molecular basis of the 
colouration in lobster shell. This article presents a review of progress 
concentrating on recent results but set in the context of more than 50 years of 
work. The blue colouration of the carapace of the lobster Homarus gammarus is 
provided by a multimolecular carotenoprotein, alpha-crustacyanin. The complex is 
a 16-mer of five different subunits each binding the carotenoid, astaxanthin 
(AXT). A breakthrough in the structural studies came from the determination of 
the structure of beta-crustacyanin (protein subunits A1 with A3 with two shared 
bound astaxanthins). This was solved by molecular replacement using 
apocrustacyanin A1 as the search motif. A molecular movie has now been 
calculated by linear interpolation based on these two 'end-point' protein 
structures, i.e. apocrustacyanin A1 and A1 associated with the two astaxanthins 
in beta-crustacyanin, and is presented with this paper. This movie highlights 
the structural changes forced upon the carotenoid on complexation. In contrast, 
the protein-binding site remains relatively unchanged in the binding region, but 
there is a large conformational change occurring in a more remote surface-loop 
region. It is suggested here that this loop could be important in complexation 
of AXT and contributes to the spectral properties. Also presented here is the 
first observation of single-crystal diffraction of the full 'alpha-crustacyanin' 
complex comprising 16 protein subunits and 16 bound AXT molecules (i.e eight 
beta-crustacyanins) at 5 A resolution. Optimization of crystallization 
conditions is still necessary as these patterns show multiple crystallite 
character, however, 10 A resolution single-crystal diffraction has now been 
achieved. Provision of the new SRS MPW 10 and SRS MPW 14 beamline robotic 
systems will greatly assist in the surveying of the many alpha-crustacyanin 
crystallization trials that are being made. New solution X-ray scattering (SXS) 
measurements of beta- and alpha-crustacyanin are also presented. The 
beta-crustacyanin SXS data serve to show how the holo complex fits the SXS 
curve, whereas the apocrustacyanin A1 homodimer from the crystal data naturally 
does not. Reconstructions of alpha-crustacyanin were accomplished from its 
scattering-profile shape. The most plausible ultrastructure, based on a fourfold 
symmetry constraint, was found to be a stool with four legs. The latter is 
compared with published electron micrographs. A detailed crystal structure of 
alpha-crustacyanin is now sought in order to relate the full 150 nm bathochromic 
shift of AXT to that complete molecular structure, compared with the 100 nm 
achieved by the beta-crustacyanin protein dimer alone. Rare lobster colourations 
have been brought to attention as a result of this work and are discussed in an 
appendix.

beta-Crustacyanin, the blue-purple carotenoprotein of lobster carapace: 
consideration of the bathochromic shift of the protein-bound astaxanthin.

The crystal structure of a beta-crustacyanin allows an analysis of the various 
proposals for the mechanism of the bathochromic shift from orange to purple-blue 
of astaxanthin in this lobster carotenoprotein. Structural and previous chemical 
and biophysical studies suggest that extension of conjugation by coplanarization 
of the beta-ionone rings with the polyene chain and polarization resulting from 
hydrogen bonding at the C(4) and C(4') keto groups may be mainly responsible for 
the bathochromic shift. Additional contributions may arise from medium effects 
and possibly from bowing of the polyene chain on binding. Previous biophysical 
data revealing a somewhat symmetrical polarization of astaxanthin in 
crustacyanin are thereby also accounted for. A puzzling feature remains 
unexplained: the bathochromic shifts, larger than that of astaxanthin, shown by 
some cyclopentenedione carotenoids in reconstituted carotenoproteins. This mini 
review enlarges on the original analysis and conclusions of Cianci et al. 
[(2002), Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 99, 9795-9800].

Models of apocrustacyanin C(1) were refined against X-ray data recorded on 
Bending Magnet 14 at the ESRF to resolutions of 1.85 and 2 A from a space-grown 
and an earth-grown crystal, respectively, both using vapour-diffusion 
crystal-growth geometry. The space crystals were grown in the APCF on the NASA 
Space Shuttle. The microgravity crystal growth showed a cyclic nature attributed 
to Marangoni convection, thus reducing the benefits of the microgravity 
environment, as reported previously [Chayen et al. (1996), Q. Rev. Biophys. 29, 
227-278]. A subsequent mosaicity evaluation, also reported previously, showed 
only a partial improvement in the space-grown crystals over the earth-grown 
crystals [Snell et al. (1997), Acta Cryst. D53, 231-239], contrary to the case 
for lysozyme crystals grown in space with liquid-liquid diffusion, i.e. without 
any major motion during growth [Snell et al. (1995), Acta Cryst. D52, 
1099-1102]. In this paper, apocrustacyanin C(1) electron-density maps from the 
two refined models are now compared. It is concluded that the electron-density 
maps of the protein and the bound waters are found to be better overall for the 
structures of apocrustacyanin C(1) studied from the space-grown crystal compared 
with those from the earth-grown crystal, even though both crystals were grown 
using vapour-diffusion crystal-growth geometry. The improved residues are on the 
surface of the protein, with two involved in or nearby crystal lattice-forming 
interactions, thus linking an improved crystal-growth mechanism to the molecular 
level. The structural comparison procedures developed should themselves be 
valuable for evaluating crystal-growth procedures in the future.

The structure of alpha-crustacyanin, the blue carotenoprotein of lobster 
(Homarus gammarus) carapace, has been investigated for the first time using 
small-angle X-ray scattering. In this paper, we have determined the dimensions 
of this protein composed of eight heterodimeric subunits of beta-crustacyanin. 
Analysis of the scattering spectra and estimation of the shape of 
alpha-crustacyanin show that the protein fits into a cylinder with an axial 
length of 238 A and a radius of 47.5 A, in which the eight beta-crustacyanin 
molecules are probably arranged in a helical manner.

The properties of (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) electron-density maps at 
medium-to-high resolutions.

This paper reports on the efficacy of (F(o) - F(c)) versus (2F(o) - F(c)) 
electron-density maps at 3.2 A resolution. Firstly, a study is reported of a 
simple truncation at 2.3 and 3.2 A of the 1.6 A resolution crystal structure of 
concanavalin A at room temperature [Emmerich et al. (1994), Acta Cryst. D50, 
749-756] with 149 known bound water molecules. Secondly, the concanavalin A 1.6 
A resolution model was re-refined but with the data truncated to 3.2 A. In a 
similar evaluation, these procedures were repeated for the apocrustacyanin A1 
cryotemperature 1.4 A resolution model [Cianci et al. (2001), Acta Cryst. D57, 
1219-1229]. Maps at 1.4, 2.3 and 3.2 A resolutions were first generated and the 
structure was then re-refined at 3.2 A and additionally at 2.3 A resolution. The 
results on concanavalin A show that the number of bound water molecules that are 
resolved decreases by two thirds from 1.6 to 3.2 A, but that key structural 
waters, for example at the transition metal and the calcium ion, are still 
resolved in the (F(o) - F(c)) map but not in the (2F(o) - F(c)) map. For 
apocrustacyanin A1, the results with these two difference maps were less 
clear-cut. Two key structural bound waters (w93 and w105) were selected that had 
been previously identified in beta-crustacyanin [Cianci et al. (2002), Proc. 
Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 99, 9795-9800] in protein-carotenoid interactions. The 
behaviour of w93 is similar to that of concanavalin A key waters, but that of 
w105 is not. These behaviours were therefore explored in finer resolution 
increments, namely 2.9, 2.7 and 2.5 A. Finally, further tests on "real" data 
sets for peanut lectin and concanavalin A at medium resolution confirm these map 
properties, namely that an (F(o) - F(c)) difference electron-density map is more 
effective than a (2F(o) - F(c)) map in showing bound water structure at lower 
resolutions ( approximately 3.2 A). This result is important since a growing 
number of protein crystal structure studies are concerned with 
multi-macromolecular complexes and are at such resolutions. Details of the bound 
solvent can still be revealed at 3.2 A via the (F(o) - F(c)) map calculation. 
The physical basis of the limitation of the (2F(o) - F(c)) map presumably lies 
in the series-termination error effect on such a map involving the first 
negative ripple from the protein atom to which a bound water oxygen is hydrogen 
bonded, sufficiently cancelling its peak. In addition, re-refinements at 3.2 A 
show distances that can agree with known values but B values that do not agree 
with known values.

The molecular basis of the coloration mechanism in lobster shell: 
beta-crustacyanin at 3.2-A resolution.

The binding of the carotenoid astaxanthin (AXT) in the protein 
multimacromolecular complex crustacyanin (CR) is responsible for the blue 
coloration of lobster shell. The structural basis of the bathochromic shift 
mechanism has long been elusive. A change in color occurs from the orange red of 
the unbound dilute AXT (lambda(max) 472 nm in hexane), the well-known color of 
cooked lobster, to slate blue in the protein-bound live lobster state 
(lambda(max) 632 nm in CR). Intriguingly, extracted CR becomes red on 
dehydration and on rehydration goes back to blue. Recently, the innovative use 
of softer x-rays and xenon derivatization yielded the three-dimensional 
structure of the A(1) apoprotein subunit of CR, confirming it as a member of the 
lipocalin superfamily. That work provided the molecular replacement search model 
for a crystal form of the beta-CR holo complex, that is an A(1) with A(3) 
subunit assembly including two bound AXT molecules. We have thereby determined 
the structure of the A(3) molecule de novo. Lobster has clearly evolved an 
intricate structural mechanism for the coloration of its shell using AXT and a 
bathochromic shift. Blue/purple AXT proteins are ubiquitous among invertebrate 
marine animals, particularly the Crustacea. The three-dimensional structure of 
beta-CR has identified the protein contacts and structural alterations needed 
for the AXT color regulation mechanism.

The C1 subunit of alpha-crustacyanin: the de novo phasing of the crystal

The previously unknown crystal structure of the C(1) subunit of the 
carotenoid-binding protein alpha-crustacyanin has been determined using the 
anomalous scattering available at 1.77 A wavelength to determine the partial 
structure of the S atoms intrinsic to the native protein. The resulting 
'heavy-atom' phases, in conjunction with near-atomic resolution (d(min) = 1.15 
A) data, were then used to initiate successful structure determination using a 
direct-methods approach. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first time such 
a small anomalous signal ( approximately 1%) has been used to aid the 
determination of a macromolecular structure. As well as the structure itself, 
the methods used during data collection and those used in the elucidation of the 
sulfur 'heavy-atom' partial structure are described here. As predicted, the C(1) 
subunit adopts a tertiary structure typical of the lipocalin superfamily: an 
eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a repeated +1 topology. The 
beta-barrel has a calyx shape with the two molecules in the asymmetric unit 
interacting in such a way that the open ends of each calyx face each other, 
although they do not form a single elongated pocket. A comparison of this 
structure with those of other members of the lipocalin superfamily has allowed 
speculation as to the nature of carotenoid binding by the protein.

The molecular basis of the camouflage colouration of marine crustacea is often 
provided by carotenoproteins. The blue colour of the lobster carapace, for 
example, is intricately associated with a multimacromolecular 16-mer complex of 
protein subunits each with a bound astaxanthin molecule. The protein subunits of 
crustacyanin fall into two distinct subfamilies, CRTC and CRTA. Here, the 
crystal structure solution of the A(1) protein of the CRTC subfamily is 
reported. The problematic nature of the structure solution of the CRTC proteins 
(both C(1) and A(1)) warranted consideration and the development of new 
approaches. Three putative disulfides per protein subunit were likely to exist 
based on molecular-homology modelling against known lipocalin protein 
structures. With two such subunits per crystallographic asymmetric unit, this 
direct approach was still difficult as it involved detecting a weak signal from 
these sulfurs and suggested the use of softer X-rays, combined with high data 
multiplicity, as reported previously [Chayen et al. (2000), Acta Cryst. D56, 
1064-1066]. This paper now describes the structure solution of CRTC in the form 
of the A(1) dimer based on use of softer X-rays (2 A wavelength). The structure 
solution involved a xenon derivative with an optimized xenon L(I) edge f" signal 
and a native data set. The hand of the xenon SIROAS phases was determined by 
using the sulfur anomalous signal from a high-multiplicity native data set also 
recorded at 2 A wavelength. For refinement, a high-resolution data set was 
measured at short wavelength. All four data sets were collected at 100 K. The 
refined structure to 1.4 A resolution based on 60 276 reflections has an R 
factor of 17.7% and an R(free) of 22.9% (3137 reflections). The structure is 
that of a typical lipocalin, being closely related to insecticyanin, to 
bilin-binding protein and to retinol-binding protein. This A(1) monomer or dimer 
can now be used as a search motif in the structural studies of the oligomeric 
forms alpha- and beta-crustacyanins, which contain bound astaxanthin molecules.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the peculiar spectral properties of the 
carotenoid astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin, the blue carotenoprotein isolated 
from the exoskeleton of the lobster Homarus gammarus, were investigated by 
comparing the basic electrooptical parameters of astaxanthin free in vitro with 
those of astaxanthin in the complex. Absorption and electroabsorption (Stark 
effect) spectra were obtained for alpha-crustacyanin in low-temperature glasses 
to provide information about the molecular interactions that lead to the large 
bathochromic shift of the spectra resulting from this complexation. The 
low-temperature spectra reveal the presence of at least three spectral forms of 
alpha-crustacyanin, with vibronic (0-0) transitions at 14000 cm(-1), 13500 
cm(-1) and 11600 cm(-1) (corresponding to approximately 630, 660 and 780 nm, 
respectively, at room temperature) and with relative aboundance 85%, 10% and 5%. 
The longer wavelength absorbing species have not previously been detected. The 
changes in polarizability and in permanent dipole moments associated with the 
S0-->S2 electronic transition for all these forms are about 1.5 times larger 
than for isolated astaxanthin. The results are discussed with reference to the 
symmetric polarization model for astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin.

The A1 subunit of the carotenoprotein alpha-crustacyanin, isolated from lobster 
carapace, has been crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. The crystals, 
grown in solutions of ammonium sulfate containing methylpentanediol (MPD), 
diffracted to 2. 0 A. The crystals are stable to radiation. The space group of 
the crystals is P2(1)2(1)2(1). The unit-cell parameters are a = 41.9, b = 80.7, 
c = 110.8 A. 'Standard structure determination' has been unsuccessful within 
this crustacyanin family. Instead, an approach based on the S atoms is being 
undertaken involving softer X-rays at the SRS, Daresbury.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations were used to 
investigate the molecular origin of the large redshift assumed by the electronic 
absorption spectrum of astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin, the major blue 
carotenoprotein from the carapace of the lobster, Homarus gammarus. Resonance 
Raman spectra of alpha-crustacyanin reconstituted with specifically 13C-labeled 
astaxanthins at the positions 15, 15,15', 14,14', 13,13', 12,12', or 20,20' were 
recorded. This approach enabled us to obtain information about the effect of the 
ligand-protein interactions on the geometry of the astaxanthin chromophore in 
the ground electronic state. The magnitude of the downshifts of the C==C 
stretching modes for each labeled compound indicate that the main perturbation 
on the central part of the polyene chain is not homogeneous. In addition, 
changes in the 1250-1400 cm(-1) spectral range indicate that the geometry of the 
astaxanthin polyene chain is moderately changed upon binding to the protein. 
Semiempirical quantum chemical modeling studies (Austin method 1) show that the 
geometry change cannot be solely responsible for the bathochromic shift from 480 
to 632 nm of protein-bound astaxanthin. The calculations are consistent with a 
polarization mechanism that involves the protonation or another interaction with 
a positive ionic species of comparable magnitude with both ketofunctionalities 
of the astaxanthin-chromophore and support the changes observed in the resonance 
Raman and visible absorption spectra. The results are in good agreement with the 
conclusions that were drawn on the basis of a study of the charge densities in 
the chromophore in alpha-crustacyanin by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. From the 
results the dramatic bathochromic shift can be explained not only from a change 
in the ground electronic state conformation but also from an interaction in the 
excited electronic state that significantly decreases the energy of the 
pi-antibonding C==O orbitals and the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Numerous reports have been published in the literature which describe the 
crystallization of macromolecules by a variety of crystallization methods, 
including the vapour-diffusion and microbatch techniques. This topical review 
compares the results of examples of proteins which were crystallized by both 
vapour-diffusion and microbatch methods. The inherent features of the 
vapour-diffusion and microbatch methods are discussed and some specific 
conditions where one method appears more favourable than the other are reported. 
Guidelines for the conversion of crystallization conditions from vapour 
diffusion to microbatch (and vice versa) are also presented.

13C Magic angle spinning NMR analysis and quantum chemical modeling of the 
bathochromic shift of astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin, the blue

Selective isotope enrichment, 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, and 
semiempirical quantum chemical modeling, have been used to analyze 
ligand-protein interactions associated with the bathochromic shift of 
astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin, the blue carotenoprotein complex from the 
carapace of the lobster Homarus gammarus. Spectra of alpha-crustacyanin were 
obtained after reconstitution with astaxanthins labeled with 13C at positions 
4,4', 12,12', 13,13', or 20,20'. The data reveal substantial downfield shifts of 
4.9 and 7.0 ppm at positions 12 and 12' in the complex, respectively. In 
contrast, at the 13 and 13' positions, small upfield shifts of 1.9 ppm were 
observed upon binding to the protein. These data are in line with previously 
obtained results for positions 14,14' (3.9 and 6.8 ppm downfield) and 15,15' 
(0.6 ppm upfield) and confirm the unequal perturbation of both halves after 
binding of the chromophore. However, these results also show that the main 
perturbation is of symmetrical origin, since the chemical shift differences 
exhibit a similar pattern in both halves of the astaxanthin molecule. A small 
downfield shift of 2.4 ppm was detected for the 4 and 4' positions. Finally, the 
20,20' methyl groups are shifted 0.4 ppm upfield by the protein. The full data 
set provides convincing evidence that charge polarization is of importance for 
the bathochromic shift. The NMR shifts are compared with calculated charge 
densities for astaxanthin subjected to variations in protonation states of the 
ring-functional groups, as models of ligand-protein interactions. Taking into 
account the color shift and other available optical data, the current model for 
the mechanisms of interaction with the protein was refined. The results point 
toward a mechanism in which the astaxanthin is charged and subject to strong 
electrostatic polarizations originating from both keto groups, most likely a 
double protonation.

The protein apocrustacyanin C1 has been crystallized by vapour diffusion in both 
microgravity (the NASA space shuttle USML-2 mission) and on the ground. Rocking 
width measurements were made on the crystals at the ESRF Swiss-Norwegian 
beamline using a high-resolution psi-circle diffractometer from the University 
of Karlsruhe. Crystal perfection was then evaluated, from comparison of the 
reflection rocking curves from a total of five crystals (three grown in 
microgravity and two earth controls), and by plotting mosaicity versus 
reflection signal/noise. Comparison was then made with previous measurements of 
almost 'perfect' lysozyme crystals grown aboard IML-2 and Spacehab-1 and 
reported by Snell et al. [Snell, Weisgerber, Helliwell, Weckert, Holzer & 
Schroer (1995). Acta Cryst. D51, 1099-1102]. Overall, the best 
diffraction-quality apocrustacyanin C1 crystal was microgravity grown, but one 
earth-grown crystal was as good as one of the other microgravity-grown crystals. 
The remaining two crystals (one from microgravity and one from earth) were 
poorer than the other three and of fairly equal quality. Crystal movement during 
growth in microgravity, resulting from the use of vapour-diffusion geometry, may 
be the cause of not realising the 'theoretical' limit of perfect protein crystal 
quality.

Heterogeneous nucleation, which is often detrimental to the production of 
suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction, can be induced by the contact of a 
crystallization sample with the walls of its supporting vessel. A novel method 
for creating a 'containerless' environment for the growth of protein crystals is 
described. Contact between the container walls and a crystallization drop is 
eliminated by suspending the drop between two oils of different density: one of 
higher and the other of lower density than that of water and the common 
precipitating agents. A number of proteins were crystallized in 2-10 microliters 
drops using this procedure. It was found that the number of crystals obtained in 
such suspended drops was reduced significantly compared with the number of 
crystals obtained in trials where the crystallization drop was situated at the 
bottom of a vial under a single layer of oil. This method has potential in 
controlling heterogeneous nucleation.

Crystals of beta-crustacyanin, a carotenoid-binding protein from lobster 
carapace, have been grown under oil from solutions containing sodium potassium 
phosphate as precipitant. They grow slowly over a period of months to reach 
maximal dimensions of 0.5 x 0.1 x 0.1 mm, and belong to space group P622 with 
cell dimensions: a = b = 124.39, c = 188.86 A and gamma = 120 degrees. The 
crystals diffract to beyond 3 A but are very radiation sensitive, limiting the 
resolution of usable data. The unit-cell volume suggests that there are two 
beta-crustacyanin molecules per asymmetric unit.

MAS (magic angle spinning) 13C NMR has been used to study protein-chromophore 
interactions in alpha-crustacyanin, the blue astaxanthin-binding carotenoprotein 
of the lobster, Homarus gammarus, reconstituted with astaxanthins labelled with 
13C at the 14,14' or 15,15' positions. Two signals are seen for 
alpha-crustacyanin containing [14,14'-13C2]astaxanthin, shifted 6.9 and 4.0 ppm 
downfield from the 134.1 ppm signal of uncomplexed astaxanthin in the solid 
state. With alpha-crustacyanin containing [15,15'-13C2]astaxanthin, one 
essentially unshifted broad signal is seen. Hence binding to the protein causes 
a decrease in electronic charge density, providing the first experimental 
evidence that a charge redistribution mechanism contributes to the bathochromic 
shift of the astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin, in agreement with inferences 
based on resonance Raman data [Salares, et al. (1979) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 
576, 176-191]. The splitting of the 14 and 14' signals provides evidence for 
asymmetric binding of each astaxanthin molecule by the protein.

Crystallisation of alpha-crustacyanin, the lobster carapace astaxanthin-protein: 
results from EURECA.

Crystallisation of alpha-crustacyanin, the lobster carapace astaxanthin-protein 
was attempted under microgravity conditions in EURECA satellite using 
liquid-liquid diffusion with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) as precipitant; in a 
second reaction chamber phenol and dioxan were used as additives to prevent 
composite crystal growth. Crystals of alpha-crustacyanin grown under 
microgravity from PEG were larger than those grown terrestrially in the same 
apparatus under otherwise identical conditions. On retrieval, the crystals from 
PEG were shown to be composite and gave a powder diffraction pattern. The second 
reaction chamber showed leakage on retrieval and had also been subjected to 
rapid temperature variation during flight. Crystal fragments were nevertheless 
recovered but showed a powder diffraction pattern. It is concluded, certainly 
for liquid-liquid diffusion using PEG alone, that, for crustacyanin, although 
microgravity conditions resulted in an increase in dimensions of crystals, a 
measurable improvement in molecular ordering was not achieved.

Complete sequence and model for the C1 subunit of the carotenoprotein,

A2 subunits with astaxanthin.

The complete sequence has been determined for the C1 subunit of crustacyanin, an 
astaxanthin-binding protein from the carapace of the lobster Homarus gammarus 
(L.). The polypeptide, 181 residues long, is similar (38% identity) to the other 
main subunit, A2 and to plasma retinol-binding protein. The tertiary structure 
of the C1 subunit has been modelled on that derived for the A2 subunit from the 
coordinates of retinol-binding protein. Residues lining the putative binding 
cavities and at the putative carotenoid binding sites of the two subunits are 
highly conserved. The carotenoid environments are characterized by a 
preponderance of aromatic and polar residues and the absence of charged 
side-chains. A tentative model for the dimer, beta-crustacyanin, formed between 
the two subunits with their associated carotenoid ligands, is discussed. The 
model is based on the crystal structure of the dimer of bilin-binding protein, a 
member of the same superfamily. This structure has enabled us to examine 
mechanisms for the bathochromic spectral shift of the protein-bound carotenoid 
and to identify likely contact regions between dimers in octameric 
alpha-crustacyanin.

The complete sequence has been determined for the A2 subunit of crustacyanin, an 
astaxanthin-binding protein from the carapace of the lobster Homarus gammarus. 
The polypeptide chain is 174 residues long and is similar to proteins of the 
retinol-binding protein superfamily. Some regions of the sequence are most 
similar to the retinol-binding protein, beta-lactoglobulin subgroup, while the 
disulphide bonding pattern is more akin to that seen in the porphyrin binding 
proteins insecticyanin and bilin-binding protein. It is beginning to appear as 
though this superfamily of proteins, characterized by a similar gross structural 
framework, may be further subdivided into interrelated subclasses. Model 
building based on the coordinates of the known structure of human plasma 
retinol-binding protein and on empirical prediction algorithms has allowed the 
putative identification of side-chains which line the binding cavity. This 
pocket is larger than in retinol binding protein and beta-lactoglobulin but does 
not allow the carotenoid to adopt a folded conformation. The amino acid 
composition of the pocket does not support a 'charge-shift'-type hypothesis to 
support the bathochromic shift phenomenon which takes place on interaction of 
the chromophore with the protein. Instead aromatic side-chains may play a 
prominent role.

Crustacyanin, cross-linked with dimethyl pimelimidate to stabilize the protein 
against denaturation, was used to test the effects of tryptophan modification 
with BNPS-skatole [3-bromo-3-methyl-2-(nitrophenylmercaptol)-3H-indole] on the 
ability of the apoprotein to recombine with astaxanthin. The cross-linked 
apoprotein re-forms alpha-crustacyanin with astaxanthin in reasonable yield 
following incubation of the protein under the conditions for tryptophan 
modification in the absence of BNPS-skatole. The BNPS-skatole-treated protein 
reconstitutes with astaxanthin to give a carotenoprotein with lambda max. at 472 
nm, that of the carotenoid in hexane, in a yield similar to that of the 
BNPS-skatole-untreated control. The implied involvement of tryptophan residues 
at the sites of astaxanthin attachment in crustacyanin and their possible roles 
in the binding sites of vitamin A in vitamin A-proteins are discussed in 
relation to the bathochromic spectral shifts of the chromophores.

The apoproteins of the lobster carotenoprotein, crustacyanin, show single 
high-affinity binding sites for the hydrophobic fluorescence probes 
8-anilo-1-naphthalenesulphonic acid and cis-parinaric acid, and exhibit 
fluorescence transfer from tryptophan to the ligands. These results, together 
with information from the amino acid sequences, infer that the native 
carotenoid, astaxanthin, is bound to each apoprotein within an internal 
hydrophobic pocket, or calyx.

[Immunochemical study of the proteins of various tissues in Crustacea 
(Decapoda): nature, role, origin].

[Article in French]

Durliat M.

The main proteins of the haemolymph of Crustacea Decapoda have been identified 
and analysed: haemocyanin, plasma coagulogen, heteroagglutinins, vitellogenins, 
and molt-related proteins. All these complex components exhibit a high molecular 
weight and as oligomeric fractions are able to aggregate or dissociate in 
subunits according to the composition of medium and experimental procedures. 
Besides their important rôle in the defense mechanism, some proteins are 
involved in the edification of diverse tissues. They are detected within 
different compartments: soft integument, calcified carapace and hepatopancreas. 
They are either in transit or sequestered or synthetized within these tissues. 
In the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus, some components have been identified in 
different compartments: --in aqueous extracts from soft integument: the 
haemocyanin, coagulogen and both fraction F1 (lipoprotein with an approximate 
molecular weight of 45 kdal) and fraction F2 related to the molt. Both 
coagulogen and fraction F2 appear sometimes as melanized. These two latter 
fractions exhibit some glucose-mannose residues and they occur with a higher 
relative amount than in the blood. --in soluble extracts from calcified cuticle: 
among the numerous fractions showing a high molecular weight, the haemocyanin 
and coagulogen are detected. --in aqueous extracts from hepatopancreas: both 
haemocyanin and coagulogen appear with a little relative amount. Components 
termed as Fa and Fb are found with a high concentration. One minor fraction is 
also detected. --in aqueous extracts from eggs: the haemocyanin and fraction Fb 
are present. Other proteins showing only some antigenic identities with those of 
the haemolymph are also detected in all these tissues. The haemolymph proteins 
are not present within these compartments following a passive diffusion. Indeed, 
their relative amount varies according to the tissue investigated and is 
different from that found in the blood. Except the haemocyanin detected in all 
tissues with different aggregation states, the haemolymph proteins identified 
vary in the organs studied. A qualitative and quantitative selection occurs when 
the blood proteins enter the other compartments. Perhaps some other proteins are 
not detected following alterations underwent either in the epithelial barriers 
or during the tannage process or the chitino-proteic complex formation or due to 
experimental procedures. On the other hand, each tissue has its own proteins. 
The integument contains crustacyanins alpha, beta, gamma; the eggs are mainly 
constituted of lipovitellins and the hepatopancreas is rich in small molecular 
weight proteins and digestive enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

The circular dichroism of ovoverdin and other carotenoproteins from the lobster 
Homarus americanus.

Young NM, Williams RE.

The circular dichroic (CD) spectra of the alpha-, beta'-, and 
gamma-crustacyanins, ovoverdin, and the yellow lobster-shell protein were 
measured in the region 200-750 nm, for comparison with the CD spectrum of the 
free carotenoid astaxanthin. The two carotenoid chromophores of ovoverdin gave a 
CD spectrum with a series of bands of alternating sign and ellipticities up to 
1.9 X 10(5) degree X cm2 X dmol-1, comparable to the low temperature CD spectrum 
of astaxanthin in the UV region. The visible region of ovoverdin also contained 
strong CD bands where astaxanthin itself has very weak ones. The blue (640 nm) 
chromophore of ovoverdin gave a broad negative CD feature quite different from 
the blue chromophores of the three crustacyanins. The crustacyanins have a broad 
positive feature between 400 and 610 nm with ellipticities up to 2 X 10(5) 
degree X cm2 X dmol-1, followed at higher wavelengths by a negative band with an 
ellipticity up to 1 X 10(5) degree X cm2 X dmol-1. Gaussian curve-fitting 
procedures showed the positive features to consist of a minimum of two or three 
CD bands. In addition to the exciton bands at the main visible absorption, the 
yellow lobster-shell protein had a pair of CD bands of equal but opposite 
ellipticity associated with an absorption band between 250 and 340 nm. The UV 
regions of the CD spectra of the five carotenoproteins have bands from both 
carotenoid and protein chromophores, and possible assignments of these bands to 
one or the other of the two types of chromophore are proposed.

Spectroscopic characterization of alpha-crustacyanin.

Lee TY, Jung J, Song P.

alpha-Crustacyanin exhibits two CD extrema with negative and positive bands at 
690 and 583 nm in phosphate buffer, respectively. The CD spectrum is interpreted 
in terms of dipoledipole coupling between the transition moments of the two 
astaxanthin molecules on each subunit. The CD splitting yields an exciton 
bandwidth of 2800 cm-1, corresponding to an inter-chromophore distance of ca. 13 
A in which the two astaxanthin molecules exist in a dimeric array with a mutual 
orientation angle of ca. 90 degrees. The SDS denaturation completely abolishes 
the long wavelength CD splitting, while 2 M NaCl reduces the overall CD 
intensity without destroying the split CD spectrum. It is suggested that the 
characteristic CD extrema at 583 and 690 nm arise from the intra-subunit 
astaxanthin-astaxanthin coupling. The binding site for astaxanthin contains one 
or more tryptophan residues, as the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched by 
energy transfer from the tryptophan to the prosthetic group in the native form 
of the carotenoprotein. The strong red shift (lambda max 487 nm) is probably due 
to interactions between tryptophan residue(s) and the chromophore molecules 
through dipole-dipole or partial charge transfer forces.

Mechanisms of spectral shifts in lobster carotenoproteins. The resonance Raman 
spectra of ovoverdin and the crustacyanins.

Salares VR, Young NM, Bernstein HJ, Carey PR.

Resonance Raman data have been used to elucidate the mechanisms of the 
absorption spectral shifts occurring for astaxanthin upon binding to the 
carotenoproteins, ovoverdin and alpha-,beta- and gamma-crustacyanins, from the 
lobster Homarus americanus. Although distinguishable on the basis of small 
differences in their resonance Raman spectra the binding sites of the 
crustacyanins, giving rise to lambdamax at 605 +/- 25 nm, are essentially the 
same. The large red shift in lambdamax for the crustacyanins compared to free 
astaxanthin (lambdamax 480 nm), is accounted for by a charge-polarisation 
mechanism in which charged groups and possibly hydrogen bonds in the binding 
site set up pi electron polarisation in the ligand. Several alternate mechanisms 
can be eliminated. Ovoverdin is found to consist of three polypeptide chains of 
molecular weight 105,000, 95,000 and 78,000 which are not linked by disulfide 
bridges. The visible absorption peaks of ovoverdin at 460 and 640 nm are shown 
to arise from two astaxanthin molecules each bound at a different site. The 
spectral characteristics of the 460 nm site suggest a rigid hydrophobic 
environment for astaxanthin, in which no charge-ligand interactions occur. The 
mechanism of the spectral shift in the 640 nm site is the same as in the 
crustacyanins, i.e. a charge-polarisation effect. Resonance Raman spectra of 
ovoverdin and the crustacyanins could be obtained in situ; they were identical 
to the spectra of the purified proteins showing that the carotenoid sites were 
unperturbed by protein isolation.
